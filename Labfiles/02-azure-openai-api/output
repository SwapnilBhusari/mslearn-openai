Response: The difficulty of the second hike I suggested near Rainier National Park can vary depending on your fitness level and hiking experience. However, on average, it is considered a moderate hike. It involves some elevation gain and may have uneven terrain, but it is not overly strenuous. It is always a good idea to check the specific trail conditions and difficulty ratings before embarking on any hike.
